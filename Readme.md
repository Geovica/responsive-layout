## About

A lot has changed in the way we used to style. Gone are the days, where we used to bust out head to center a div within another div. Introducing our new champ **Flexbox**. Responsive design has never been this easy.

## Key Highlights

- Mobile First Design
- SASS mixins
- Flexbox based fluid layouts
- Pure CSS - no JS

This site has been cross tested in Chrome, FireFox and Safari but _NOT in Internet Explorer_ as I don't have a windows machine with me. Mostly, everything should work fine, but be warned, this code is not IE battle tested.
